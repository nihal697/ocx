# NEWER = flows added after the initial activation suite (#82's
# directory-picker/all-sessions/variant-picker, #101's diff-scroll) that have
# never once run to completion in CI: they always sat behind the positive
# flow's stale SSE-reply assertion (issue #90 mode B, now fixed) or the
# negative-401 flow's stale "401" assertion (also now fixed), both of which
# made the job fail before reaching them — so they were merged and have been
# running unverified against the current UI/mock ever since. Run them for
# visibility (each flow's pass/fail is reported below) but don't block on
# them yet — see issue #104 for hardening them (fixing whatever stale
# selectors/seeding surface) and moving each back into CORE once confirmed
# green.

# Decisive probe: can the EMULATOR actually reach the host mock via 127.0.0.1?
# If any in-emulator method prints the health JSON, the network path is good
# and any flow failure is app-side; if none succeed, attribution falls back to
# a host-side check + adb reverse state so we at least know the mock is up.
# `toybox wget`/`nc` don't work reliably on the API-28 image (wget: unknown
# command; nc connects but the request/response framing is unreliable) — so
# this tries curl (if present), then mksh's /dev/tcp pseudo-device (a shell
# builtin, not an external binary, so it survives whatever toybox applets
# this image did/didn't build), then nc as a last in-emulator attempt, before
# falling back to a host-side confirmation. This never blocks the flow — the
# result is recorded and the script continues regardless.
