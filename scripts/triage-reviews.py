"""
Play Store review triage script.

Fetches recent Play Store reviews via the Android Publisher API and maintains
a single, sanitized, aggregated GitHub issue summarizing low-rated reviews so
they enter the normal fix cycle without manual monitoring.

Privacy: the created/updated issue is public, so it never contains a
reviewer's name or verbatim review text. It only contains star-rating
counts, a paraphrased common-terms summary derived from word frequency
(not quoted sentences), and opaque review_id references an operator can
look up in the Play Console.

Dedup: an HTML comment marker embeds the sorted set of review_ids
represented in the issue (same pattern as scripts/product-intelligence.mjs).
If the current run's actionable review_id set is unchanged from the
marker, the run skips without touching the issue. Otherwise it
creates the issue (first run) or updates it in place.

Required env vars:
  GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON  — full JSON key for the service account
  GH_TOKEN                     — GitHub token with issues:write scope
  PACKAGE_NAME                 — Android package (com.ocx.app)
  DAYS_BACK                    — how many days back to look (default 7)
